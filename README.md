# pandoc-server

A small example of a servant-based server for doing pandoc conversions.
Customize to fit your needs!

## Installation

You will need [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
or `cabal`. With `stack`:

```
% stack install
```

The executable will be put in `~/.local/bin`, so make sure this
is in your path.

## Running the server

```
% pandoc-server
```

This makes the server available at localhost port 8080.

## Using the server

There are two endpoints.

`/convert` expects a POST request with a JSON body containing
the following fields:

- `text` (text to convert)
- `from` (defaults to `"markdown"`)
- `to` (defaults to `"html"`)
- `wrapText` (`"WrapAuto"` (default), `"WrapNone"`, or `"WrapPreserve"`)
- `columns` (integer, defaults to 72)
- `standalone` (boolean, defaults to false)
- `template` (defaults to the default template for the output format)

Example of use (with `httpie`):

```
% http POST http://localhost:8080/convert text=:+1: from=markdown+emoji to=mediawiki Accept:text/plain
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 30 Jun 2021 15:51:15 GMT
Server: Warp/3.3.16
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

<span class="emoji" data-emoji="+1">üëç</span>
```

`/convert-batch` expects a POST request with a JSON body
containing a list of JSON objects of the sort provided to
`/convert`.  (This can be used to save on network overhead.)

It returns a JSON list of the converted results.

Example of use (with `curl`):

```
% cat d.json
[
  {
    "from": "markdown",
    "to": "latex",
    "text": "*Hello* world."
  },
  {
    "from": "markdown",
    "to": "html",
    "text": "*Hello* world."
  }
]
% curl -d @d.json -H Content-Type:application/json -H Accept:application/json http://127.0.0.1:8080/convert-batch
["\\emph{Hello} world.","<p><em>Hello</em> world.</p>"]%
```

## Performance

Measured with `ab` on a 2.3 GHz i9 MacBook Pro:

- For 10,000 sequential conversions of a very short
  text from markdown to latex, 2852 requests per second.

- With 10 parallel threads making requests, 4081 requests per
  second.

Better performance can be achieved by using `/convert-batch`.
